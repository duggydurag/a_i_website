Interesting Content: An interesting topic but could use a bit more detail and depth 
Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation: Esthetically the website looks good and the images are also well chosen and formated correctly
Quality of Written Presentation: Lacked a lot of content and explanations
Validity of HTML: Clear HTMl, no inconsistencies
Evidence of Collaboration: 
  Author info not written by author: There is evidence of collaboration as we can see that someone other than the owner of the repository pushed a file onto this project 
  Balanced Contribution from all members: It seems that both pages are similar and would have requaired the same amount of work form all the people in the group
  Not completed at the last minute: The files were pushed onto the repositroy about 7 days ago which shows that the porject was completed on time
